Get the latest and trending in machine learning research from [paperswithcode.com](https://paperswithcode.com) right on telegram ðŸ™‚

Currently hosted at [@MLpaperz](https://t.me/MLpaperz) on telegram.

This is a telegram bot which scrapes the latest and trending research work from [paperswithcode.com](https://paperswithcode.com) then uploads it to a telegram channel. The project was inspired from a conversation with a friend, I was talking to him about the latest paper release in NLP (at the time of writing) which is **roBERTa** and was surprised he hasn't heard about it. Then I asked him if he reads research papers and he said no because there's no way he could be checking research paper sites everyday for new releases and if there was a way he could be getting the updates on his phone it would be nice and I decided to create this to solve that problem.
